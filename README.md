  <h2>introduction</h2>
  <p> guys, here I just give a simple example,<br> 
    I use the <strong>Android</strong> platform, with the aim of being like iOS, desktop<br>
    You can make sure this file runs well <br>
    There are many ways that can be used to create Discord authorization <br>
    for example on the page <strong><a href="https://discordjs.guide/oauth2/#implicit-grant-flow">another example</a></strong>.<br>
    but back again to my goal, creating a file like this I hope you all like it <br>
    thank you and good luck trying it</p><br>

  <h2>about</h2>
  <p>Maybe most Discord bot developers need a dashboard, and need several other needs such as creating a website for their bot,However, they also need permission to access photos, IDs and names from the Discord account they use, or other things such as requiring guild access, email or whatever depending on their goals.</p><br>
